  <p1>The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.<br> </p1>
  <p2>This is zero-player game. All you can do is to create an initial configuration and observe how it evolves.<br><br></p2>
  <br> <b> This app requires MATLAB runtime 9.9 to work! </b>
  <br> Download here:  <a href=> https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html </a> <br><br>
  <p3><b>CONTROLS</b><br> </p3>

  <p4><br> By clicking white(dead) cell you make it black(live)<br><br> Start button will start your game. Quit button will quit the app.<br> Clear button will set all cells to white.<br>Other buttons will create some predefined configuration for the game like so: </p4>

  <p5><br>There are two scales(sliders) wich control number of generated generations and number of randomly generated alive cells.<br> Your selected value on scale must be confirmed via save button under it.<br></p5>

  <br><br>
   TEXT INPUT button opens new window:<br>
  <img src="textinput.png" width="506" height="320"><br>
  Here you are able to input your configuration in text format<br>
  Character O indicates alive cell and . indicates dead cell.<br> 
  You can get your inspiration at: <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Category:Lists_of_patterns"> https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Category:Lists_of_patterns </a><br> <br> 
  Number of generated generations and number of randomly generated alive cells can be set in previous window<br>
  CLOSE button closes the window.<br>
  START button runs the game with your configuration.

  <p6><b>RULES</b><br> </p6>
  The universe of the Game of Life is two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states,live or dead. <br>
   Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.<br>
    At each step in time, the following transitions occur:<br><br>
    1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.<br>
    2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.<br>
    3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.<br>
    4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.<br><br>
    These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:<br><br>
    1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.<br>
    2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.<br>
    3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead<br>
    <br>
     The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed, live or dead;<br> births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. <br>
      Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.<br><br><br><br>
